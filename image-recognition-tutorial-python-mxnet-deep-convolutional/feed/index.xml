The first problem could be related to the image preprocessing (normalization and so on). 
About bounding box, lastly, I found very useful https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK on a Kaggle problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Lorenzo, 
Thanks for the post. I&#039;m working on a problem where I have to recognise products which have similar packaging but with different colours. I did train a VGG net and an Alexnet with my images with a test accuracy of 60%, however, when an unknown image is fed into the network for classification, the results are not great. 
I get only 2 out of 10 images correctly identified and sometimes none. Also sometimes It also considers background and gives me wrong results. For example, class A product colour is white and there&#039;s a grey background and class B, product is grey in colour while the background is white. Now when I feed in an image from class B which is grey in colour, it gets identified as class A.
Can you tell me how can I fix this ? 

PS: I&#039;m working to get the bounding box and train the images with FAST RCNN which might work, but not sure on that either as there&#039;s very little available on the internet. 

Best,
Pramod]]></description>
